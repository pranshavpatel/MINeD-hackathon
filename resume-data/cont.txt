ABOUT ME/OTHER 
 
• 
I’ve been a youth lacrosse coach for a few years, running offensive practices for juniors/seniors in summer club ball for 
the Colorado Fire team. In high school I was a 2x varsity captain and all-state as a sophomore-senior. At CU I got MCLA D1 
player of the week my first week of games as a freshman; I immediately peaked unfortunately.  
• 
Am currently restoring a 70’ Ford Bronco and a ’78 BMW R100RS, very slowly. I try and build things every so often, 
weather its auto/moto, woodworking, or applications. 
• 
I enjoy traveling, bikes of any degree, doing nothing at the beach/park with friends (we call it rotting), consuming books 
at irregular intervals, making a leisurely espresso in the morning, and drawing on my chalk board. I strive for originality in 
everything I do and find peoples passions contagious and motivating. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, 
create, and round myself and my experiences.

Summary
I met computers when I was 9 years old and I loved them because they were faster than Atari, and they were
3D. Forced myself to learn. Didn't mind that I didn't have a diploma because they didn't teach that kind of stuff
in school back then. I decided to improve myself instead of going to school and I have no regrets. Currently,
Have enough software knowledge for myself, I do not have any trouble using hardware and software. Apart from
computers, interested in 3D printers and CNC machines. Take courses in order to become familiar with artificial
intelligence issues and try to apply them as much as I can. Already have experiences from IT and AI field is very
promising. It would be great if I combine them in to IT field so I can solve problems very efficient and accurate.
